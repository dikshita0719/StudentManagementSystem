# Student Records Management System (Java)
This is an intermediate-level Java project that demonstrates core object-oriented programming concepts along with the use of essential data structures like ArrayList and HashMap. The project simulates a simple `Student Record Management System` where student data can be added, updated, deleted, and analyzed.

## Features
- Add, update, and delete student records
  
- Search students by roll number
  
- Calculate average marks and assign or update grades
  
- Find the topper (student with highest average marks)
  
- Display all student details in a clear format

## What I Learned / Applied

- Java `Classes` and `Objects` with proper encapsulation 

- Use of `ArrayList` to manage collections of objects

- `HashMap` for subject-to-marks mapping

- Method overriding (`toString`)

- Input validation and exception handling

- Basic algorithm for finding max average (topper)

- Clean code practices for maintainability

## How to Run

#### Compile the classes:

###### <pre> javac Student.java StudentManager.java Main.java </pre>

#### Run the main program:

###### <pre>  Main.java </pre>

## Future Improvements

- Implement Inheritance to introduce a `Person` superclass to encapsulate common attributes

- Develop `SchoolRecordManager`to manage student records by class/grade, enabling authorized users to handle records for the entire school effectively.
